# diy-3d-printer

This repository contains the design files for a 3D printer that I built from scratch. The design is based on the [Ender 3](https://www.creality.com/products/ender-3-3d-printer) and uses a Cartesian coordinate system. The printer is designed to be easy to build and maintain, and it is capable of printing a wide range of materials.
